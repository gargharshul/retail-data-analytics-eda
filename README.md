# Retail data analytics
The Challenge - One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales – the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.

2. Promotional Markdowns data

## Markdown Analysis w.r.t Holidays
If the company provides markdown during a holiday, there is a hike in sales value

## Recommendations
1. Divest in the departments which have low sales numbers.
2. Invest in the more profitable departments where there is opportunity to increase sales.
3. Type C stores show an increasing trend of sales over the years, so there is a scope of increasing the number and size of type C stores.
4. Markdowns have a positive effect on sales during the holidays, so these companies should continue providing markdowns on holiday weeks.
